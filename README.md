Random CryptoNews from around the world.


--- This project is under GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE v2 ---


The news are focused on:

* En-/Decryption topics (common)
* SSL/CA auth./TLS certificates
* Router (common attacks)
* HTTP
* Fingerprinting (common)
* DNS (security news and attack news)
* GitHub (random news)
* Firewall (security, hacking, ...)
* Spying/Mass surveillance 


I'm not responsible for external linked content. All links are checked (as of time of posting) and 'clean'. Since nothing can be re-checked every second you must scan and check each link on your own. 


The goal of this small project is to track 'important' news by year and relevance. 


ToDo:
* Better look maybe github.io page?!
* .....
